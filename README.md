# Netapp-Extractor
 ran into a small issue when I was looking for some netApp data in Graylog; it was missing a few extractors so I couldn't find the data that was most relevant to me at that time.

Fortunately, Graylog offers a very versatile extractor section -it accepts regular expressions- so I gave myself some keyboard exercise and made myself a batch of netApp extractors.

I thought it would be nice to share them, just in case anybody would need it. It could save you quite some time...

You should be able to import the extractors in Graylog without any fuss.
